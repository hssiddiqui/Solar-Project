# Solar-Project
Solar calculator, solar tracking and more

This repository contains codes to 

calculate solar radiation incident on a surface given the input paramters such as location, orientation and time of day
predict the output of the panel given the ambient conditions such as temperature
perform solar tracking for optimized yield
